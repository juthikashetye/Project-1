# muirl - Meet Up In Real Life

## About the app

* This is a matching app which finds a person and place for you based on your location and interests.
* You even have an option to book a Lyft ride to the place chosen for you.
* The app uses Google and Lyft API.
* Information like your name, email address, interests and location is collected by the app.
* The content is completely responsive.
* This project is still developing. There are some parts which we would like to improve and build up on.

## Working of the app

* Clone the app and go to `assets/javascript/app.js`
* Search for `function loadMapAndLyft()` and inside this function, replace the variable `gMapApiKey` value to your Google maps API key by going to https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
* Search for the `//Lyft button for page reload` section and replace the `clientId` and `clientToken` with your own Lyft credentials by going to https://developer.lyft.com/docs
* You will need to use your own Google and Lyft API keys for the app to work.
* If you want to see the live app without the google map and lyft ride booking then this is the [Link to the muirl app](https://juthikashetye.github.io/muirl/)
